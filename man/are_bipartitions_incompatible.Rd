\title{Check if two bipartitions drawn from trees with the same tips are incompatible with eachother.
Each bipartition is defined as a vector of the names of the tips on one side of the
bipartition.}
\usage{
are_bipartitions_incompatible(bi1, bi2, phy)
}
\arguments{
\item{bi1}{The first bipartition.}

\item{bi2}{The second bipartition.}

\item{phy}{A phylo object describing a tree that includes all tips under investigation.
This is used to infer the other half of each bipartition.}

\value{
TRUE if bi1 is incompatible with bi2, otherwise FALSE.
