\title{Check if bipartition bi is incompatible with the bipartitions in bi_list.
Each bipartition is defined as a vector of the names of the tips on one side of the
bipartition.}
\usage{
is_incompatible_with_set(bi, bi_list, phy)
}
\arguments{
\item{bi}{The query bipartition.}

\item{bi_list}{A list of the bipartitions to be compared against.}

\item{phy}{A phylo object describing a tree that includes all tips under investigation.
This is used to infer the other half of each bipartition.}
}
\value{
TRUE if bi is incompatible with any bipartition in bi_list, otherwise FALSE.
