# hutan 0.5.0

- Prepared for release.

# hutan 0.1.0

- First pass at hutan, motivated largely by the desire to implment 
`zero_constrained()` and `is_monophyletic()`. Other functions were 
created largely in service of these two.

- Built out a variety of other functions for tree manipulations 
we regularly do.
